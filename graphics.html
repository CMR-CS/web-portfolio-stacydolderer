                <h2>Evaluation of web graphics</h2>

                <p>Site evaluated: <a href="http://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a></p>

                <h3>Purpose of graphics on this site:</h3>
                <p>The graphics on the UN home page are subtle, but help to make the page more attractive and to communicate key concepts regarding the UN's mission. The most prominent image is the banner, which includes the UN logo, the word "United Nations" and the tag-line "We the peoples... A stronger UN for a better world" and a world map. There are also three semi-transparent background images in the center of the page, showing flags and people. Each of these images suggests and symbolizes independent nations working together as one body, one world.</p>

                <h3>Guidelines for effective use of graphics</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Yes - Graphics fit the purpose, organization, and style of the page.</li>
                    <li>Yes - Large graphics have been avoided.</li>
                    <li>Yes - Graphics help to guide the viewers’ focus to the important content on the page.</li>
                    <li>Yes - Overly bright and potentially “obnoxious” images have been avoided.</li>
                    <li>Yes - Graphics have not been used for textual content, other than the banner.</li>
                    <li>Yes - Alternate text is present for all images.</li>
                    <li>Yes - Where text appears in graphics (the banner) there is ample contrast.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 id="filetypes">Graphic File Types</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Pixel</dt>
                    <dd>Tiny dot of color that makes up digital images</dd>
                    <dt>Resolution</dt>
                    <dd>The number of pixels that are displayed per inch for an image (or pixels per centimeter)</dd>
                    <dt>Lossy Compression</dt>
                    <dd>Compression type that permanently looses data when the graphic is compressed</dd>
                    <dt>Lossless Compression</dt>
                    <dd>Compression type that does not loose data when the graphic is compressed</dd>
                    <dt>JPEG</dt>
                    <dd>The jpeg image format allows up to 16 million colors and is the best choice for image with many colors or color gradations (especially photographs). Jpeg is a “lossy” format which means that each time the image is saved and compressed, image information is lost and quality is degraded. Jpeg images allow for various levels of compression. Low compression means high image quality, but large file size. High compression means lower image quality, but smaller file size.</dd>
                    <dt>PNG</dt>
                    <dd>(Progressive Network Graphics) PNG is a newer image format that provides a combination of many features of both jpeg and gif. The PNG format allows for use of millions of colors as well as providing the ability to have transparent backgrounds. The one drawback to PNG’s is that the format is not supported by all web browsers, particularly older browsers.</dd>
                    <dt>SVG</dt>
                    <dd>The SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector format. It is widely becoming popular because of the number of amazing things that can be done with it. SVG is written in XML-based markup, it is just like HTML for illustrations and it's quite different from other image formats we have talked about.

                        SVGs are very scalable. They are vectors and are drawn from mathematically declared shapes and curves and such, so pixels are no limitation, unlike the other formats that depend on pixels. They look the same no matter the screen size and level of magnification of screen. This makes then great for responsive design.</dd>
                    <dt>GIF</dt>
                    <dd>(Graphic Information Format) Gif is a “lossless” image format, meaning that the quality of the image is not degraded through compression. The limitation of gif images is that the color palette includes only 256 colors. Therefore, the gif format is a good choice for simpler graphics with a smaller number of solid colors. The gif format also allows for transparent backgrounds, which allows the background color of the web page to show behind the graphic.</dd>
