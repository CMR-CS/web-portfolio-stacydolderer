                <p>In this unit we learned a little bit about the history of the Internet.  We began making basic web pages that have the necessary framework elements such as <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Next we learned about basic text formatting elements like headings and lists.  We also learned to create hyperlinks and mark up advanced text such as blockquotes, pieces of code, dates and time, and much more. We learned about the importance of setting up the document structure correctly so assistive technologies like screenreaders can recognise those elements and help with tasks like <em>"find the main navigation"</em>, or <em>"find the main content."</em>  The last and most fun lesson in this unit was inserting images and video into our web pages. </p>
